# Introduction to Programming Projects
A collection of projects done in ECE 118. Programming basics, with a teaching style
that is similar to functional programming, emphasizing recursion and constants over
loops and variables.

## Requirements
Much of the work here is built with a beginner library developed by Dr. Stephen Murrell
called "library.h". The library provides wrappers around some basic C++ functionality
as well as a simple graphics drawing interface. The header file along with the object
code are provided (and in general, publically available at: http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/library/index.html), 
but their use/distribution beyond the running of this code is subject to the approval 
of Dr. Stephen Murrell. Documentation on some of the library functions can also be 
found at that link.

The code for most projects (barring #6 and #10) were written using Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 Professional. The other projects were written under FreeBSD.
